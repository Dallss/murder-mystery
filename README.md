## Integration Tests

Integration tests cover major user flows between the frontend and backend, using mocks for external dependencies (LLM, Supabase, Redis). These tests live in `backend/tests/` and use the Flask test client.

### Running Integration Tests

To run a specific integration test (e.g., board state sync):

```
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_integration_board.py -v
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_integration_story.py -v
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_integration_clue.py -v
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_integration_auth.py -v
```

### Whatâ€™s Covered
- Board state synchronization (save/load)
- Story progression
- Clue management
- Authentication flows

Mocks for Supabase and Redis are provided in `backend/tests/mocks/`.
