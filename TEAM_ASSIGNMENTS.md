1. Team Member 1 can work on FE-004 immediately, then move to BE-004
2. Team Member 2 can work on TEST-001 immediately, then start FE-005
3. Team Member 3 can work on DB-002 immediately, then start BE-005 once BE-004 is complete
4. Team Member 4 can work on FE-006 immediately, then start AI-010
5. Team Member 5 can work on TEST-002 immediately, then DB-003 and BE-006 sequentially

## 📊 Workload Distribution

| Team Member | Total Hours | Task Count |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Team Member 1 | 12h | 2 |

### Note on Workload Balance

The current distribution has a slightly higher workload for Team Members 4 and 5, but this balances out the lighter workload they had in Milestone 1. Team Member 4 now has more diverse tasks as promised, working on both frontend and AI components.

For Milestone 3, we'll ensure that:
1. The workload continues to be balanced across all team members
2. Tasks are distributed to leverage each member's experience from previous milestones
3. Team Members 1, 2, and 3 get slightly more work to balance out the overall project contribution

## 📝 Communication Plan

- **Daily Standup**: 15-minute meeting at 10:00 AM
- **Code Reviews**: Required for all PRs before merging
- **Weekly Planning**: 1-hour meeting every Monday at 2:00 PM
- **Documentation**: All team members responsible for documenting their work

## 🚀 Next Steps After Milestone 2

After completing Milestone 2, the team will move on to Milestone 3, focusing on:

1. Advanced board visualization and interaction
2. Suspect and clue management
3. AI agent integration and testing
4. End-to-end testing

For Milestone 3, we'll create a new balanced task distribution that continues to leverage everyone's full-stack capabilities.

## 📈 Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked in the TASKS.md file, with regular updates to the Task Updates section.
