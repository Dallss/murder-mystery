## 📅 Timeline

### Week 1
- Team Member 1: Complete FE-001, BE-001, start DB-001
- Team Member 2: Start FE-002 (after FE-001 is complete), start TEST-001 (after FE-001 is complete)
- Team Member 3: Wait for FE-001 and FE-002 to start FE-003
- Team Member 4: Wait for BE-001 to start AI-001
- Team Member 5: Start DB-002, wait for BE-001 to start TEST-002

### Week 2
- Team Member 1: Complete DB-001
- Team Member 2: Complete BE-002, TEST-001
- Team Member 3: Complete FE-003, BE-003
- Team Member 4: Complete AI-001
- Team Member 5: Complete DB-002, TEST-002

## 🔄 Dependency Management

The tasks have been assigned to minimize blocking dependencies between team members:

1. Team Member 1 works on both frontend and backend initialization, enabling other team members to build on these foundations
2. Team Member 2 can start on FE-002 and TEST-001 once FE-001 is complete
3. Team Member 3 can start on FE-003 once FE-001 and FE-002 are complete
4. Team Member 4 can start on AI-001 once BE-001 is complete
5. Team Member 5 can work on DB-002 immediately after SETUP-003 is completed

## 📊 Workload Distribution

| Team Member | Total Hours | Task Count |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Team Member 1 | 7h | 3 |
| Team Member 2 | 8h | 3 |
| Team Member 3 | 8h | 2 |
| Team Member 4 | 8h | 1 |
| Team Member 5 | 9h | 2 |

### Note on Workload Balance

The current distribution achieves a better balance with most team members having 7-9 hours of work. Team Member 4 has only one task, but it's a substantial one (8 hours) that requires focused attention on setting up the AI framework.

For Milestone 2, we'll ensure that:
1. Team Member 4 gets more diverse tasks
2. The workload continues to be balanced across all team members
3. Tasks are distributed to leverage each member's experience from Milestone 1

## 📝 Communication Plan

- **Daily Standup**: 15-minute meeting at 10:00 AM
- **Code Reviews**: Required for all PRs before merging
- **Weekly Planning**: 1-hour meeting every Monday at 2:00 PM
- **Documentation**: All team members responsible for documenting their work

## 🚀 Next Steps After Milestone 1

After completing Milestone 1, the team will move on to Milestone 2, focusing on:

1. Basic narrative interface
2. Story progression endpoints
3. StoryAgent implementation
4. Integration tests

For Milestone 2, we'll create a new balanced task distribution that continues to leverage everyone's full-stack capabilities.

## 📈 Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked in the TASKS.md file, with regular updates to the Task Updates section.
