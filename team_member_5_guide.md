## Task Details and Implementation Guide

### BE-010: Create user progress saving/loading endpoints

#### Description
Implement Flask API endpoints for saving and loading user progress in the mystery. Integrate with Supabase and the frontend to ensure seamless experience and data persistence.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Review user progress data model and requirements**
   - Examine how progress is tracked in the frontend and backend.
   - Identify required fields and relationships.

2. **Design API endpoints**
   - Plan endpoints for saving and loading progress.
   - Define request/response formats and error handling.

3. **Implement Flask routes**
   ```bash
   # Create user progress routes file
   touch backend/routes/user_progress_routes.py
   ```

4. **Integrate with Supabase and frontend**
   - Use Supabase for persistent storage.
   - Ensure endpoints are called from the frontend at appropriate times.

5. **Add authentication and authorization**
   - Use JWT or session-based auth for protected endpoints.

6. **Write unit tests**
   ```bash
   # Create test file
   touch backend/tests/test_user_progress_routes.py
   ```

### DB-005: Set up Redis schema for caching

#### Description
Design and implement the Redis schema for caching needs in the backend. Document cache structure and policies, and integrate with backend services for performance improvements.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Review caching requirements and current usage**
   - Identify what data should be cached and for how long.
   - Review current Redis setup and integration points.

2. **Design cache key structure and policies**
   - Plan unique keys for each cache entry.
   - Set expiration and eviction policies.

3. **Implement caching logic in backend services**
   - Add Redis get/set logic where needed.
   - Handle cache misses and errors gracefully.

4. **Document cache structure and usage**
   - Update documentation with cache key formats and policies.

5. **Write unit tests for caching logic**
   ```bash
   # Create test file
   touch backend/tests/test_redis_caching.py
   ```

### FE-B002: Create mobile-responsive design

#### Description
Refactor the frontend for full mobile responsiveness. Test across devices and browsers, and collaborate with the frontend team for consistency and best practices.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Review current frontend layout and components**
   - Identify areas that are not mobile-friendly.
   - Review Tailwind CSS usage and responsive utilities.

2. **Refactor components and layouts**
   - Use Tailwind's responsive classes to adjust layouts for different screen sizes.
   - Ensure all interactive elements are touch-friendly.

3. **Test across devices and browsers**
   - Use browser dev tools and real devices to test responsiveness.
   - Fix any layout or usability issues found.

4. **Collaborate with frontend team**
   - Share findings and improvements with the team.
   - Ensure consistency in design and user experience.

5. **Write E2E and component tests for mobile**
   ```bash
   # Create or update test files
   touch frontend/tests/components/MobileResponsiveness.spec.js
   # Add E2E tests as needed
   ```
