## Task Details and Implementation Guide

### BE-008: Develop board state synchronization API

#### Description
Implement Flask API endpoints for real-time board state synchronization between frontend and backend. This ensures that all users see a consistent detective board and that state is persisted and restored correctly.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Review detective board and backend structure (FE-006, FE-007, BE-006, BE-007)**
   - Understand how board state is managed in the frontend and backend.
   - Identify data models and synchronization requirements.

2. **Design API endpoints**
   - Plan endpoints for getting, updating, and broadcasting board state.
   - Define request/response formats and error handling.

3. **Implement Flask routes**
   ```bash
   # Create board state routes file
   touch backend/routes/board_state_routes.py
   ```

4. **Integrate with Redis for real-time sync**
   - Use Redis pub/sub or caching for fast state updates.
   - Ensure atomic updates and conflict resolution.

5. **Add authentication and authorization**
   - Use JWT or session-based auth for protected endpoints.

6. **Write unit and integration tests**
   ```bash
   # Create test file
   touch backend/tests/test_board_state_routes.py
   ```

### BE-009: Implement Redis caching for LLM responses

#### Description
Set up Redis caching for AI/LLM API responses to improve performance and reduce redundant calls. Optimize cache keys and expiration policies for best results.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Review LLM integration and caching needs**
   - Identify which LLM responses should be cached.
   - Review current Redis setup and usage.

2. **Design cache key structure and expiration**
   - Plan unique keys for each LLM request/response pair.
   - Set appropriate expiration times for cache entries.

3. **Implement caching logic in backend services**
   - Add Redis get/set logic around LLM API calls.
   - Handle cache misses and errors gracefully.

4. **Add monitoring and logging**
   - Log cache hits, misses, and errors for analysis.

5. **Write unit tests for caching logic**
   ```bash
   # Create test file
   touch backend/tests/test_llm_caching.py
   ```

- [Pytest Documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/)

### TEST-004: Develop integration tests for frontend-backend

#### Description
Write integration tests covering major user flows between the frontend and backend. Use mocks and stubs for external dependencies. Integrate with CI for automated testing.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Review major user flows and API endpoints**
   - Identify key interactions between frontend and backend.
   - Review existing integration test coverage.

2. **Set up integration test framework**
   ```bash
   # Ensure pytest and related packages are installed
   pip install pytest pytest-cov
   ```

3. **Create/expand integration test files**
   ```bash
   # Create or update integration test files
   touch backend/tests/test_integration_board.py
   touch backend/tests/test_integration_story.py
   # ...etc.
   ```

4. **Use mocks/stubs for external services**
   - Mock LLM, Supabase, and Redis as needed for isolated tests.

5. **Write tests for expected, edge, and failure cases**
   - Cover all major user flows and error handling.

6. **Integrate with CI**
   - Ensure tests run automatically in GitHub Actions or your CI pipeline.

- [Testing Flask Apps](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/testing/)
- [Mocking in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html)
