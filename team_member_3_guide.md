## Task Details and Implementation Guide

### BE-011: Backend error handling & logging improvements

#### Description
Enhance error handling and logging throughout the backend. Ensure all endpoints and services provide clear, actionable error messages and robust logging for debugging and monitoring.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Audit current error handling**
   - Review all Flask routes and services for error handling gaps.
   - Identify areas lacking logging or with unclear error messages.
2. **Design improvements**
   - Propose standardized error response formats and logging conventions.
3. **Implement improvements**
   - Update routes/services to use improved error handling and logging.
   - Integrate with logging tools (e.g., Sentry, Python logging).
4. **Test error scenarios**
   - Simulate failures and verify error responses/logs.
5. **Document changes**
   - Update backend docs and PRs with new conventions.

#### Resources
- [Flask Error Handling](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/errorhandling/)
- [Python Logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)
- [Sentry for Python](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/)

### DEP-002: Backend deployment pipeline setup (CI/CD)

#### Description
Set up a robust CI/CD pipeline for the backend using GitHub Actions or a similar tool. Automate linting, testing, build, and deployment to staging/production environments.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Review deployment requirements**
   - Confirm target environments (staging, production) and deployment platform (e.g., Render).
2. **Design CI/CD workflow**
   - Plan steps: install, lint, test, build, deploy.
   - Define environment variables and secrets management.
3. **Implement GitHub Actions workflow**
   - Create or update `.github/workflows/backend.yml` for automated pipeline.
   - Add steps for linting, testing, building, and deploying.
4. **Test pipeline**
   - Trigger builds on PRs and main branch merges.
   - Fix any issues and ensure reliable deployments.
5. **Document deployment process**
   - Update README and internal docs with deployment instructions and troubleshooting tips.

### TEST-007: Backend regression & load testing

#### Description
Set up and run regression and load tests for the backend. Use tools like pytest, Locust, or k6 to ensure stability and performance under load.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Set up regression/load testing tools**
   - Integrate pytest for regression and Locust/k6 for load testing.
2. **Write regression/load test cases**
   - Cover all major endpoints and edge cases.
3. **Automate tests in CI**
   - Ensure tests run on PRs and main branch merges.
4. **Review and fix issues**
   - Address any failures or performance bottlenecks.
5. **Document testing process**
   - Update docs with test coverage and known issues.

#### Resources
- [pytest Documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/)
- [Locust Load Testing](https://locust.io/)
- [k6 Load Testing](https://k6.io/)
