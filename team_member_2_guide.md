## Task Details and Implementation Guide

### FE-013: Advanced board features (grouping, filtering, search)

#### Description
Implement advanced features for the detective board, including grouping elements, filtering by type/status, and a search bar for quick navigation. Enhance usability for complex mysteries.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Review current board implementation**
   - Identify areas for grouping, filtering, and search integration.
2. **Design feature UI/UX**
   - Sketch or prototype grouping/filtering/search controls.
   - Plan Pinia store updates for new features.
3. **Implement grouping/filtering/search**
   - Update Vue components and Pinia store logic.
   - Ensure features are performant and intuitive.
4. **Test across scenarios**
   - Verify features with large/complex boards.
   - Fix edge cases and usability issues.
5. **Document new features**
   - Update user documentation and PRs.

### FE-014: Polish clue/suspect detail modals & animations

#### Description
Refine the UI/UX of clue and suspect detail modals. Add smooth animations, improve layout, and ensure consistency with the overall design system.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Audit current modals**
   - Identify visual/interaction issues and gather feedback.
2. **Design improvements**
   - Propose animation and layout enhancements.
3. **Implement polish**
   - Update modal components, add/adjust animations (using GSAP or Vue transitions).
4. **Test on all devices**

   - Integrate Cypress for E2E and Percy for visual diffs.
2. **Write regression test cases**
   - Cover all major user flows and edge cases.
3. **Automate tests in CI**
   - Ensure tests run on PRs and main branch merges.
4. **Review and fix regressions**
   - Address any issues found during testing.
5. **Document testing process**
   - Update docs with test coverage and known issues.
