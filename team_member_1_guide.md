   - List all a11y issues and prioritize by severity and user impact.
3. **Implement fixes**
   - Add/adjust ARIA attributes, improve color contrast, ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
   - Update forms, modals, and dynamic content for screen reader compatibility.
4. **Re-test and validate**
   - Re-run audits and manual tests to confirm fixes.
5. **Document accessibility status**
